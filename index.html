      <h3>Become a Good cricketer</h3>

      <p>
        It goes without saying that Shakib Al Hasan has had a dream run, so
        far, in the ongoing ICC World Cup being played in England and Wales.
        The all-rounder has not only led the charge with the bat in crunch
        situations but also inflicted key breakthroughs whenever his skipper
        Mashrafe Mortaza has thrown the ball to him. As a result, he is the
        sole reason for Bangladesh's fifth position in the points table
        following a 62-run win over Afghanistan at The Rose Bowl, Southampton
        on Monday.
