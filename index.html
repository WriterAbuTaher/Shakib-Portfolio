          It goes without saying that Shakib Al Hasan has had a dream run, so far, in the ongoing ICC World Cup being played in England and Wales. The all-rounder has not only led the charge with the bat in crunch situations but also inflicted key breakthroughs whenever his skipper Mashrafe Mortaza has thrown the ball to him. As a result, he is the sole reason for Bangladesh's fifth position in the points table following a 62-run win over Afghanistan at The Rose Bowl, Southampton on Monday.
